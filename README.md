> This project is still in a very, very early stage. Early enough to keep the backend private for the sake of security. Give it a Star and click "Watch" if you want to stay up-to-date,
an auto-deployed version can be found on [beam.cafe](https://beam.cafe) - it might be down as it's still WIP (and because the auto-deployment is not very smooth yet).
